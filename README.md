For future me, likely tomorrow me, use the files in the Jackson Neiser folder and download them or whatever, then, follow these steps to use them for Java x Json programming:
1. Either move files to downloads or dont touch them at all.
2. Press "alt" + "\" or the 4 horrizontal lines next to the Intellij Logo
3. Press "ctrl" + "alt" + "shift" + "S" or click "Project Structure..."
4. Under "Project Settings" click "Modules" then click on "Dependencies"
5. Click the "+" button and then press "1" or click "JARs or Directories"
6. Scroll down to "Downloads" and hold "shift" while clicking on the recently downloaded "Jackson Neiser files"
7. Pop something that will get you properly messed up as now you are ready to program, yippeee...
